# Using the Db2 database assistant
{: #database-assistant}

Chat with the IBM Db2 database assistant to help you complete tasks, find out about your system status and statistics, or ask general questions about Db2.
{: shortdesc}

Open the database assistant from the Db2 web console, and then ask it to help you with a range of Db2 tasks, including:
- Answering your questions about Db2
- Detecting and helping to resolve lock contention issues
- Monitoring your Db2 instance, including getting information about:
    - Active connections
    - SQL activity
    - Resource usage
    - Schemas, table spaces, indexes, and tables in the system
    - Users
    - Backups
    - Compute scaling
    - Storage scaling

The database assistant uses built-in skills and is trained on the official IBM Db2 documentation so that it can provide you with the most accurate responses.

## Starting the database assistant
{: #assistant-getstarted}

To get started with the database assistant:

## Troubleshooting the Db2 database assistant
{: #assistant-troubleshooting}

If you find that you are not getting the answers and results that you expect from the Db2 database assistant, try one or more of the following troubleshooting strategies:
- Rephrase the question. The assistant might not understand your phrasing. Try using different wording, if possible.
- Restart the conversation. The assistant might be getting confused by other things you have discussed with it.
- Ensure that you are asking about Db2. If you are asking about something else, it might be outside of the assistant's capabilities.
- Try asking about something specific. If your question is too broad, the assistant is more likely to return results that aren't relevant to your request.
- Ensure that you are not filtering by version. If an answer to your question isn't available in the current documentation release, the assistant won't find it. If you're filtering by version, some content might be missing. To broaden the search, type "change version" and then choose "Any".

## Data privacy and opting out
{: #assistant-data-privacy}

When you interact with the Db2 database assistant, your questions and requests are processed by IBM watsonx Orchestrate, which is outside of your Db2 instance. Only the text that you input into the assistant gets processed by watsonx Orchestrate. None of your actual data or metrics leave your Db2 instance at any time.
