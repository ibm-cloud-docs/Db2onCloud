# Migrating data to IBM Cloud
{: #migration}

You can load data from a data file in a delimited format (CSV or TXT) on a local network or in an object store (Amazon S3 or IBM Cloud Object Storage) to {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}}. You can even migrate your data from an on-premises system.
{: shortdesc}

## Loading data from object store
{: #cos}

To load data from Amazon S3, select one of the following methods:
  * {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} web console. **Load > Amazon S3**. 
  * External Tables directly. The following is an example SQL statement:

    ```
    INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
      (CCSID 1208 s3('s3.amazonaws.com', 
      '<S3-access-key-ID>',
      '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
      '<my_bucket>'
         )
      )      
    ```

To load data from IBM Cloud Object Storage by using External Tables directly, the following is an example SQL statement:

```
INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
  (CCSID 1208 s3('s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net', 
  '<S3-access-key-ID>',
  '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
  '<my_bucket>'
     )
  )      
```

For IBM Cloud Object Storage, to create HMAC credentials when creating new service credentials, specify {"HMAC:true"} in the *Add Inline Configuration Parameters* field.
{: note}

## Migrating large amounts of data from on-premises system
{: #onprem}

<!--
To migrate 25 TB of data and greater: see [IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration](#mdms)
-->

To migrate your data from an on-premises system, choose one of the following methods depending on the size of your data set:
* Less than 25 TB of data: [IBM Lift CLI](#lift)
* 25 TB of data and greater: [IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration](#mdms)

### Lift CLI
{: #lift}

Lift CLI support coming soon.  

The following workaround can be used to perform the function as a Lift PUT

```
This is an example code snippet which uses curl and jq:
url = {YOUR CONSOLE URL}
crn = {SERVICE INSTANCE CRN}
user = {DB2 USER}
password = {DB2 PASSWORD}

1. Retrieve your token
token=`curl -s -X POST https://$url/dbapi/v4/auth/tokens -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-deployment-id: $crn" -d "{\"userid\": \"$user\", \"password\": \"$password\"}" | jq -r '.token'`

2. If you have a file test.csv on your local path and you want to upload it to the Db2 on Cloud server
curl -s -X POST https://$url/dbapi/v4/home_content/ -H "authorization: Bearer $token" -H "x-deployment-id: $crn" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F 'test.csv=@test.csv'
Examples in Java, Python etc are provided here - https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/db2-on-cloud/db2-on-cloud-v4#introduction

```
