# Automatic upgrading
{: #auto_upgrade_plans}

Starting on **November 9, 2020**, any {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} legacy plan instances for which the upgrade was not initiated will be automatically upgraded unless you [created a support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to request an extension. The instances will be upgraded in batches between **November 9** and **November 30, 2020**.
{: shortdesc}

The auto-upgrade process is initiated on the back end by the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} team. Auto upgrade is an offline process and requires that you take steps to recover the instance. **Access to your system will not be available until the recovery steps are completed.** 

For more information about the recovery process, see [Recovery steps after auto upgrade](/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-recovery){: external}.

## Automatic transitions
{: #auto_transitions}

The deadline to initiate the transition to a new plan instance applies only if you self-initiated the upgrade on or before **November 5, 2020**. The deadline to self-initiate the transition from the legacy instance is **November 15, 2020, 8 PM ET**. Any {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} legacy plan instances for which the transition was not self-initiated before the deadline will be automatically transitioned starting on **November 16, 2020**, unless you [created a support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to request an extension.
