# Backup and restore
{: #bnr}

For paid plans, encrypted backups of the database are done daily. A daily backup is kept for each of the last 14 days.
{: shortdesc}

<!-- In addition to standard backups, you can use the [Time Travel Query](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html){:external} to keep historical data for other purposes, such as instantly querying old data or simplified auditing. You can also do your own exports by using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool. -->
 
For information about point-in-time restores, see [Point-in-time restore](#point-in-time).

All paid plans make use of IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) to keep backups offsite.  <!-- However, Sydney and certain smaller data centers might not support offsite replication with IBM COS at this time. Check the [IBM COS documentation](/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints) for your region to determine which regions support offsite replication. -->

<!-- You can also use [IBM Lift CLI](https://www.lift-cli.cloud.ibm.com/){:external} to import data into {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}. -->

## Point-in-time restore
{: #point-in-time}

{{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} added a point-in-time restore capability for systems in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. You can restore to an exact point in time from your backups. 

The following are a selected example of screen captures of the web console UI in which the point-in-time restore operation is initiated and its progress is indicated:

### Enterprise and Standard Plans

1. Click on **Administration** on the Left Menu and then select the **Backup** tab on the top menu 
2. Click on the Down Arrow besides the **Backup** button

3. Select a point-in-time date to which you want to restore the database. The point-in-time restore process selects the backup closest to your requested point-in-time date out of the pool of retained backups made during the previous 14 days.

    The point-in-time restore process invalidates any of the previously retained backups with dates after the selected point-in-time date because of a resultant divergence in the timeline.

4. Restoring the database to the selected point in time.

5. The restore operation completed successfully.

### Legacy Plans

1. Select the **Point in Time** restore strategy and select a point-in-time date to which you want to restore the database. The point-in-time restore process selects the backup closest to your requested point-in-time date out of the pool of retained backups made during the previous 14 days. 

   The point-in-time restore process invalidates any of the previously retained backups with dates after the selected point-in-time date because of a resultant divergence in the timeline.

2. Confirm that you want to continue with your restore selections. After initiating the restore operation, you cannot change the request.
