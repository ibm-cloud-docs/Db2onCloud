![View of completed backup](images/backup_completed_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 4. View of a completed backup" caption-side="bottom"}

<!-- In addition to standard backups, you can use the [Time Travel Query](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html){:external} to keep historical data for other purposes, such as instantly querying old data or simplified auditing. You can also do your own exports by using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool. -->
 
## Restore
{: #br_restore}

All paid plans have the ability to restore backups to either end-of-backups or to a point-in-time.

For information about point-in-time restores, see [Point-in-time restore](#point-in-time).

All paid plans make use of IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) to keep backups offsite. 

<!-- However, Sydney and certain smaller data centers might not support offsite replication with IBM COS at this time. Check the [IBM COS documentation](/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints) for your region to determine which regions support offsite replication. -->

<!-- You can also use [IBM Lift CLI](https://www.lift-cli.cloud.ibm.com/){:external} to import data into {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}. -->

### End-of-backup restore
{: #br_eobrestore}

![View of the highlighted selection of the end-of-backup restore option](images/eobrestore_selection_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 5. View of the selection of the end-of-backup restore option" caption-side="bottom"}

2. Click **Restore** to initiate the restore.
![View of Restore backup screen option](images/eobrestore_restore_backup_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 6. View of Restore backup" caption-side="bottom"}

![Start of the end-of-backup restore](images/eobrestore_started_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 7. Start of the end-of-backup restore" caption-side="bottom"}

4. A progress bar indicates the progress of the restore process.
![Progress of the end-of-backup restore](images/eobrestore_progress_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 8. Progress of the end-of-backup restore" caption-side="bottom"}

5. Notifications show a **Restore success!** message after the restore is completed.

### Point-in-time restore
{: #point-in-time}

{{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} added a point-in-time restore capability for systems in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. You can restore to an exact point in time from your backups. 

The following are a selected example of screen captures of the point-in-time restore operation in the web console UI:

#### Enterprise and Standard plans
{: #br_pit_ent_std}

1. Click **Administration** in the left menu and select the **Backups** tab. 

2. Click the down arrow beside the **Run backup** button. Select **Restore (point-in-time)**.
![View of the highlighted selection of the point-in-time restore option](images/pit_restore_pick_v2.png "Backup and restore console page"){: caption="Figure 10. View of the selection of the point-in-time restore option" caption-side="bottom"}

3. Select a point-in-time date to which you want to restore the database. The point-in-time restore process selects the backup closest to your requested point-in-time date out of the pool of retained backups made during the previous 14 days.

   The point-in-time restore process invalidates any of the previously retained backups with dates after the selected point-in-time date because of a resultant divergence in the timeline.
   {: note}

#### Legacy plans
{: #br_legacy}

1. Select the **Point in Time** restore strategy and select a point-in-time date to which you want to restore the database. The point-in-time restore process selects the backup closest to your requested point-in-time date out of the pool of retained backups made during the previous 14 days. 

   The point-in-time restore process invalidates any of the previously retained backups with dates after the selected point-in-time date because of a resultant divergence in the timeline.
