# About
{: #about}

{{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} is a fully managed public cloud service on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As a relational database, it delivers fast query processing with enterprise-level performance and capabilities for online transactional processing (OLTP). The new Enterprise High Availability plan runs the powerful Db2 11.5 engine, and also provides multizone region support in a three HA node configuration to ensure ultimate redundancy.

## Key features
{: #ab_key_features}

### Scalable and elastic cloud service

{{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} is an elastic service, and allows you to independently scale compute and storage through an intuitive UI or REST API.

### Expertly managed and highly secure

Day-to-day operations for {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}, including database monitoring, uptime checks and failovers, are fully automated. Operations are supplemented by a DevOps team that are on call to handle unexpected system failures. Data is encrypted at rest and in motion by default. Administrators can also restrict access to sensitive data through data masking, row permissions, and role-based security, and can utilize database audit utilities to maintain audit trails for their database. IBM Key Protect and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint are also supported.

### Run your own apps

In addition to the integrated tools, you can connect many popular third-party BI and visualization apps that you might already be using. For example, connect IBM InfoSphere Data Architect to design and deploy your database schema, or connect SQL-based tools such as Watson Analytics and Cognos Analytics to manipulate or analyze your data. For the managed service, you can connect other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} applications.

### Graphical user interface or command line

You can use the web console to perform many key tasks, such as loading data, working with tables, run SQL, and monitoring. Alternatively, you can use the command-line user interface CLPPlus to define, edit, and run statements, scripts, and commands.

## Plans and configurations
{: #plans_cfgs}

You can choose a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} plan that is configured and optimized for the work that you need to do:
{: shortdesc}

   * A Flex plan (recommended) in which you can independently scale RAM, storage, and compute resources
   * Precise Performance plans that provide fixed resources and bare metal servers
   * Each plan can be configured for high availability and Oracle compatibility.

For heavy analytics or warehousing workloads, consider [{{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/db2-warehouse-on-cloud){:external}.

If you don't see a configuration in the catalog that you need, contact [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/connect/ibm/us/en/?lnk=fcw){:external} to discuss other options.

## Pricing
{: #pricing}

Prices are stated in monthly terms (for example, $189 USD per month) for an activated service. 

If the activated service is terminated before the month ends, the monthly price reflects the portion of the month during which the service remained activated.

### Billing examples
{: #billing_examples}

In the following billing examples, an example plan charge of $189 USD per month is used.

**Example 1: Monthly billing**

While the service remains activated for each monthly billing period, a charge of $189 USD per month is billed even if the service sits idle.

**Example 2: Daily billing**

Billing for Flex plans is based on peak daily usage. For example, if you scale up from 2 to 8 cores for one hour of a day, you are billed for 8 cores for only that day, and 2 cores for all of the other days of the month.

**Example 3: Prorated billing**

If an activated service with a monthly charge of $189 USD per month was used for 20 days out of the 30 days in the month before the service was terminated, the bill for the usage would be $189 USD x 20/30 = $126 USD.
