# Data security and encryption
{: #encryption}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} service has security built into all levels of its architecture.
{: shortdesc}

The following methods are used to secure your data:
- By default, VPC volumes are encrypted at rest with IBM-managed encryption. Bring-your-own-key [(BYOK)](/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-key-protect-v2) for encryption is also available through [Key Protect](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-importing-keys) integration.
- Backups are encrypted. 
- Data in motion is encrypted through SSL/TLS. The current supported version of this encryption is TLS 1.3.
- All {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} storage is provided on storage encrypted by using AES-256 encryption.
- Backplane network connectivity is supported through {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Service Endpoints
- Database-level security is supported through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row and Column Access Control (RCAC)

Administrators can make encrypted connections mandatory. For more information, see [SSL connectivity](/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-ssl_support).
