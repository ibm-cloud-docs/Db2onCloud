# Connecting programmatically by using the driver package
{: #con_program}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} driver package contains software for connecting client applications to a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database. 
{: shortdesc}

## JDBC
{: #con_prog_jdbc}

Define a connection between a Javaâ„¢ application and the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database.
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq61}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the [prerequisites](/docs/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

<!-- Before you can connect to your database, you must perform the following steps:

- [Verify prerequisites](prereqs.html), including installing driver packages, configuring your local environment, and downloading SSL certificates (if needed)
- Collect [connection information](credentials.html), including database details such as host name and port numbers, and connection credentials such as user ID and password -->

### Procedure
{: #proc61}

#### Enterprise/Standard Plans
In each Java application, specify the user ID and password by including the **DriverManager.getConnection** method, and then include one of the following JDBC URL strings:

- For a connection with SSL:

  `jdbc:db2://<host_name>:<port>/bludb:user=<userid>;password=<your_password>;sslConnection=true;`


#### Legacy Plans

In each Java application, specify the user ID and password by including the **DriverManager.getConnection** method, and then include one of the following JDBC URL strings:

- For a connection with SSL:

  `jdbc:db2://<host_name>:50001/BLUDB:sslConnection=true;`

- For a connection without SSL:

  `jdbc:db2://<host_name>:50000/BLUDB`

## .NET
{: #con_prog_net}

Define a connection between a .NET application and your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database. 
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq71}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the [prerequisites](/docs/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

<!-- Before you can connect to your database, you must perform the following steps:

- [Verify prerequisites](prereqs.html), including installing driver packages, configuring your local environment, and downloading SSL certificates (if needed)
- Collect [connection information](credentials.html), including database details such as host name and port numbers, and connection credentials such as user ID and password -->

### Procedure
{: #proc71}

The following steps show you how to connect your application to the database with .NET.

1. From a command prompt, enter the following commands. These commands create new entries in the driver configuration file (`db2dsdriver.cfg`) on your computer and set the connection attributes. You need to do this step only one time.
    #### Enterprise/Standard Plans
    - For a connection with SSL:

      `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port <port>`

      `db2cli writecfg add -dsn <alias> -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port <port>`

      `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port <port> -parameter "SecurityTransportMode=SSL"`

      where:

      `<hostname>`: The host name of the server.

      `<port>`: The port number of the server
    
      `<alias>`: The name for a DSN alias that you want to use to establish the .NET connection. Choose a name that is meaningful to you; for example, `analytics`.


   #### Legacy Plans     
   - For a connection with SSL:

     `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50001`

     `db2cli writecfg add -dsn <alias> -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50001`

     `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50001 -parameter "SecurityTransportMode=SSL"`

     where:

     `<hostname>`: The host name of the server.
    
     `<alias>`: The name for a DSN alias that you want to use to establish the .NET connection. Choose a name that is meaningful to you; for example, `analytics`. 

   - For a connection without SSL:

     `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50000`

     `db2cli writecfg add -dsn <alias> -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50000`

2. (*Optional*): To verify the .NET connection to the database, enter the following command at a command prompt:

   `testconn40 "DATABASE=<alias>;UID=<user_id>;PWD=<password>;"`

   where:

   `<alias>`: The name of the DSN alias that you created with the **db2cli writecfg** command in step 1.
    
   `<user_id>`: Your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID. 
    
   `<password>`: The password that you use to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database. 

### Example
{: #ex71}

The following syntax shows sample C# code that uses the .NET driver to make a connection to the database.

```

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DB2Command MyDB2Command = null;
            // Use the dsn alias that you defined in db2dsdriver.cfg with the db2cli writecfg command in step 1.
            String MyDb2ConnectionString = "database=alias;uid=userid;pwd=password;"; 
            DB2Connection MyDb2Connection = new DB2Connection(MyDb2ConnectionString);
            MyDb2Connection.Open();
            MyDB2Command = MyDb2Connection.CreateCommand();
            MyDB2Command.CommandText = "SELECT branch_code, city from GOSALES.BRANCH";
            Console.WriteLine(MyDB2Command.CommandText);

            DB2DataReader MyDb2DataReader = null;
            MyDb2DataReader = MyDB2Command.ExecuteReader();
            Console.WriteLine("BRANCH\tCITY");
            Console.WriteLine("============================");
            while (MyDb2DataReader.Read())
            {
                for (int i = 0; i <= 1; i++)
                {
                    try
                    {
                        if (MyDb2DataReader.IsDBNull(i))
                        {
                            Console.Write("NULL");
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            Console.Write(MyDb2DataReader.GetString(i));
                        }
                    }
                    catch (Exception e)
                    {
                        Console.Write(e.ToString());
                    }
                    Console.Write("\t"); 

                }
                Console.WriteLine("");
            }
            MyDb2DataReader.Close();
            MyDB2Command.Dispose();
            MyDb2Connection.Close();
        }
    }
}

## PHP
{: #con_prog_php}

Define a connection between a PHP application and a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database.
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq101}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the [prerequisites](/docs/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

<!-- Before you can connect to your database, you must perform the following steps:

- [Verify prerequisites](prereqs.html), including installing driver packages, configuring your local environment, and downloading SSL certificates (if needed)
- Collect [connection information](credentials.html), including database details such as host name and port numbers, and connection credentials such as user ID and password -->

### Procedure
{: #proc101}

#### Scenario 1: Connecting from outside {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}:
{: #scen1}

1. Download the [Db2 driver package](/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-drvr_pkg) from the web console, and then install the driver package on the machine where your PHP application will run.
                
2. Use the [`odbc_connect` function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.odbc-connect.php){:external} to connect to the BLUDB database.
    
   PHP code example:

   ```
   <?php
   $database = "BLUDB";          # Get these database details from
   $hostname = "<Host-name>";    # the web console
   $user     = "<User-ID >";     #
   $password = "<Password>";     #
   $port     = "<non-ssl_port>"; #
   $ssl_port = "<port>";         #
   # Build the connection string
   #
   $driver  = "DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};";
   $dsn     = "DATABASE=$database; " .
              "HOSTNAME=$hostname;" .
              "PORT=$port; " .
              "PROTOCOL=TCPIP; " .
              "UID=$user;" .
              "PWD=$password;";
   $ssl_dsn = "DATABASE=$database; " .
              "HOSTNAME=$hostname;" .
              "PORT=$ssl_port; " .
              "PROTOCOL=TCPIP; " .
              "UID=$user;" .
              "PWD=$password;" .
              "SECURITY=SSL;";
   $conn_string = $driver . $dsn;     # Non-SSL
   $conn_string = $driver . $ssl_dsn; # SSL
   # Connect
   #
   $conn = odbc_connect( $conn_string, "", "" );
   if( $conn )
   {
       echo "Connection succeeded.";
       # Disconnect
       #
       odbc_close( $conn );
   }
   else
   {
       echo "Connection failed.";
   }
   ?>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Saving this PHP code example to a script file called `C:\sample.php` and then running the script from a command line produces the following output:

   ```
   C:\> php â€“f sample.php

   Connection succeeded.
   ```

#### Scenario 2: Connecting from a PHP web app in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #scen2}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, create a new PHP App.
        
2. From the "Getting Started" section of the new PHP App in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, download the App starter code to your local work directory.
        
3. In your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, create a new connection from your Db2 service to your new PHP App. (Creating this Connection in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} makes the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable available to your PHP App. The `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable contains database details for your Db2 service. Using `VCAP_SERVICES` is more convenient than hardcoding the database details in your PHP App.)
        
4. In your local working directory, update the `index.php` file to connect to the BLUDB database by using the [`db2_connect` function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.db2-connect.php){:external}.
        
   Example:

   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>PHP Starter Application</title>
       <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
   </head>
   <body>
   <?php
   if( getenv( "VCAP_SERVICES" ) )
   {
       # Get database details from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable
       #
       # *This can only work if you have used the Bluemix dashboard to 
       # create a connection from your dashDB service to your PHP App.
       #
       $details  = json_decode( getenv( "VCAP_SERVICES" ), true );
       $dsn      = $details [ "dashDB" ][0][ "credentials" ][ "dsn" ];
       $ssl_dsn  = $details [ "dashDB" ][0][ "credentials" ][ "ssldsn" ];
       # Build the connection string
       #
       $driver = "DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};";
       $conn_string = $driver . $dsn;     # Non-SSL
       $conn_string = $driver . $ssl_dsn; # SSL
       $conn = db2_connect( $conn_string, "", "" );
       if( $conn )
       {
           echo "<p>Connection succeeded.</p>";
           db2_close( $conn );
       }
       else
       {
           echo "<p>Connection failed.</p>";
       }
   }
   else
   {
       echo "<p>No credentials.</p>";
   }
   ?>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

5. From your local working directory, push the updates to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by following the instructions in the "Getting Started" section of the PHP App in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. Then, restart the App in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and view the App in a browser.
