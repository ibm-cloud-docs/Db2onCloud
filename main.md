# Maintenance Window
{: #self_serve_update}

Routine maintenance windows are scheduled to ensure that your IBM® Db2® on Cloud system receives the latest features, patches, and upgrades. During these maintenance windows, updates are applied automatically without your intervention. For posts of maintenance windows, see [IBM Cloud status: Planned Maintenance.](https://cloud.ibm.com/status/maintenance?component=dashdb) We contact you directly if your system specifically needs maintenance.

If you have business situations or conditions that might be impacted by the scheduling of our maintenance windows, open a [support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/login?redirect=%2Funifiedsupport%2Fcases%2Fadd) to inform us about your concerns.
