# Copy Database
{: #cp_db}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} Copy Database feature gives you the ability to copy your existing database to a new instance or easily change plans and instance types. 
{: shortdesc}

The following examples are helpful use cases for using a copy of a database:
- Run analytics or reports.
- Make a fresh copy of your production database each morning to use for development purposes.
- Make a *template* database for an app, and make a copy of that template as your apps need it.
- Move from a single node instance to a HA instance or vice versa.
- Move between Standard or Enterprise Plans.

Because the copy instance creates a new instance and restores your existing backup, itâ€™s important to keep the following in mind:
- Create a full backup of the data you want restored onto the copy.  Any data written after the backup will not be moved across.
- When moving between plans or instance types, an outage will be required to point your apps to the new hostname and port.
